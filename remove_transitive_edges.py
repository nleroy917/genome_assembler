    graph.dot is a file with a directed graph. The first row is always
        
        Digraph G {

    and the last row is always 

        }

    Each row in the middle section describes an edge. For example,

        1 -> 2

    is a directed edge from a node with the label '1' to the node with the label    '2'.
